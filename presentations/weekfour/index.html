    <!--- This information below can be done as different pages if you have extra time (create a nav bar)-->
    <h1> Competitors</h1>
    <h2>Brands</h2>
    <p> Nestle and Hersheys
    </p>

    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <p> Hersheys: Hershey has grown from one product one plant to a $4 billion company with various quality chocolates.They employ around 16,000 employees. Nestle: Nestle is world renowed, and they do indivudal branding for all the items they offer. They
        also have a large workforce.
    </p>

    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
    <p>
        Hersheyâ€™s Global market share is very low, around 10%, and they have very few multinational distrubutiors. Nestle has had legal and cosumer issues. They had a huge baby formula boycott. They also have many items they are known for, and having so many
        seperate brands can cause problems.
    </p>

    <h1>Logo Inspiration</h1>
    <h2>How the logo shows what the company is about</h2>
    <p>
        I will be using the colors provided to create a logo that shows what the company is all about.

    </p>

    <h2>Why the logo is effective for the brand</h2>
    <p>
        The logo will be consitent with the colors and what they are trying to sell (chocolates). It shows what the brand is all about.
    </p>

    <h2>How the branding/logo makes us stand out</h2>
    <p>
        The branding and logo will make us stand out because it will be different than the competitors. It will also make us stand out because of the unique colors.
